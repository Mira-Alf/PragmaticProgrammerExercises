Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate.The program
must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

Constraints
• Enter the tip as a percentage.For example,a 15% tip would be entered as 15,not 0.15.Your program should handle the division.
• Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent.

Challenges
When you’ve finished writing the basic version of the program, try tackling some additional challenges:
• Ensure that the user can enter only numbers for the bill amount and the tip rate. If the user enters non-numeric
values, display an appropriate message and exit the program. Here’s a test plan as an example:
Input: billamount:abcd tip rate:15
Expected result: Please enter a valid number for the bill amount.
• Instead of displaying an error message and exiting the program, keep asking the user for correct input until
it is provided.
• Don’t allow the user to enter a negative number.
• Break the program into functions that do the computations.
• Implement this program as a GUI program that automatically updates the values when any value changes.
• Instead of the user entering the value of the tip as a percentage,have the user drag a slider that rates
satisfaction with the server,using a range between 5% and 20%.
